This work was done as one of my portfolio projects with Coursera.

FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset made available through Möbius on Kaggle with a CC0: Public Domain license, allowing us to freely use it.

The dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
